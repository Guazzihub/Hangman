ðŸ“œ Rules

Objective:

- Guess the hidden word one letter at a time within 7 attempts.

How to Play:

- At the start of the game, youâ€™ll see the word represented by underscores (e.g., _ _ _ _).
- Enter a single letter to guess. Both uppercase and lowercase inputs are treated equally.
- Correct guesses reveal the position(s) of the letter in the word.
- Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining attempts by one.

Winning Condition:

- Correctly guess all the letters before running out of attempts, you win!
Losing:

- After using all 7 attempts without guessing the word, you lose, and the game ends.

Special Notes:

- Repeated guesses of the same letter will not count as a new attempt but will notify you.
- Only alphabetic inputs are allowed. Invalid inputs, such as numbers or symbols, prompt an error message.

Audio Feedback:

- A sound plays when you make a mistake.
- Another celebratory sound plays upon winning.

Retry: After a win or loss, youâ€™ll be prompted to play again or exit the game.
